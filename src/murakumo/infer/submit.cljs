(ns murakumo.infer.submit
  "Enqueue one `qwen38-generate` job — a real prompt for a bare-metal AIUEOS
  device — and optionally wait for the token array it generates.

  Protocol v3 of the device-P256 worker (network-awai/cloud-murakumo-api
  `docs/device-worker-v3.md`) carries the prompt as an array of vocabulary ids
  rather than as text, because the device has no tokenizer. So the caller
  tokenises, and the caller detokenises. This is that caller.

  ## Why the bounds are not repeated here

  The server owns the contract: 1..32768 prompt tokens, 1..4096 max-tokens,
  every id below the 248320-entry vocabulary, greedy only. It refuses a
  violation with one pinned literal, and this command prints that literal
  verbatim. Restating the numbers here would create a second copy that drifts
  silently the day the vocabulary changes — the failure mode where a client
  refuses a job the server would have accepted, or promises one it would not.
  Pre-flight here is STRUCTURAL only: is this actually a vector of token ids.

  ## Why the tokenizer is injected

  `torch.tokenizer` is portable `.cljc`, but it lives in a west sibling. This
  namespace does not require it, so `--tokens-file` — the path that always
  works — needs nothing on the classpath but this repository, and the whole
  core is testable without a second checkout. `scripts/infer-submit.cljs`
  supplies `encode`/`decode` from torch.

  It does NOT read a `.gguf`. `torch.gguf` — the thing that turns GGUF
  tokenizer metadata into a `torch.tokenizer` — is `.clj`, JVM-only, and this
  client runs on nbb. A JVM-free GGUF metadata reader is real work and is not
  in this command; until it exists, extract the vocabulary once with the JVM
  and keep the EDN."
