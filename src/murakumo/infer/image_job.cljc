  "An image render as a queue job: the pure half.

  Owner instruction 2026-09-10: publish the WAI image capability on
  murakumo.cloud as the free `awai-network/hokusai`.

  ## Why the pull queue and not an inbound gateway

  The obvious shape is a gateway that reaches into a node and renders. The
  fleet already has one for gad -- a Cloudflare Tunnel to a bridge on
  `gad:8189`. Building the second one the same way was rejected on the day's
  measurements: **the minis have no reliable inbound path.** issachar and
  joseph were up, on the LAN, with port 22 open and no credential or route
  that reached them, because their only way in was an overlay network that
  had dropped. An image tier fronted by an inbound tunnel inherits exactly
  that failure.

  The pull queue does not. It is outbound-only, it is what the text plane
  already uses, and a node behind a broken tunnel simply stops claiming.

  ## The size ceiling is measured, not chosen

  `waiREALMIX_v11` on a 16 GiB M4, 25 steps, warm:

      768x768    72 s   swap -40 MB    compressed 0.11 GB   stable
      1024x1024 152 s   swap +1675 MB  compressed 5.94 GB   swapping

  So 1024 is refused rather than served slowly. A free tier that pages is not
  a slower free tier; it is a node that stops answering its heartbeat while it
  thrashes, which takes the whole node out of the pool."
