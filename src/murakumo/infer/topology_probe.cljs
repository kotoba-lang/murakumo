;; The default port is 40060, below macOS' 49152-65535 ephemeral range. That is
;; not a preference: measured 2026-08-15, a first run on 50060 failed on `asher`
;; alone, which is exactly the node fleet.edn already moved off 50052 because
;; tailscaled owns persistent outbound flows in that range. The probe reported
;; those two boundaries as unverified rather than inventing numbers for them,
;; which is how the collision was visible at all.
;;
;; This is the feed for murakumo.infer.topology. It produces observations; it
;; makes no decisions, and in particular it never decides that an observation
;; it failed to take is fine. Every fact it emits carries `:method`, and the
;; core refuses the ones that are claims rather than transfers.
;;
;; ── the two commands that look alike and are not ──────────────────────
;;
;; `nominal` reads what each interface says it negotiated. It is fast, safe,
;; moves no traffic, and CANNOT lift the evidence gate. It is here because
;; knowing the fleet claims 1000baseT is genuinely useful for planning a cable
;; purchase -- just not for planning a tensor-parallel run.
;;
;; `measure` moves real bytes between real pairs. Only its output counts.
;;
;; They are separate verbs on purpose. A single `probe` that silently fell back
;; from one to the other would reintroduce exactly the ambiguity the topology
;; core exists to remove.

  the same mistake one layer down.
