;; murakumo.infer.credits — the inference economy as pure ledger math (cljc).
;;
;; What is scarce on this fleet is MEMORY×TIME: a node that holds 11 GB of a
;; model resident for an hour cannot host anything else with that memory. So a
;; run's credits flow to nodes ∝ (resident shard bytes × run duration) — the
;; same quantity the planner partitions by, which makes the economy and the
;; placement one system: the plan IS the cap table of the run.
;;
;; Design stance (ADR-2607022000):
;; - settle/1 and balances/1 are PURE folds — they run identically in bb, the
;;   JVM, the CF Worker (cloud-murakumo /infer/credits) and a kotoba WASM
;;   component reading the same Datom log.
;; - The ledger is kotoba-style: an append-only, per-actor-signed event feed
;;   (cloud-murakumo /infer/runs, kqe-assert! datoms on the mesh). That is
;;   tamper-EVIDENT, not a consensus blockchain — no global ordering war, one
;;   graph per key-derived IPNS name, CACAO-signed writes (kotoba.cacao).
;;   Cross-actor disputes settle by replaying both signed feeds.
;; - Prices are per-model in the registry (:credit/per-token). The head (API
;;   terminator) earns :credit/head-frac for conducting + its own layers; a
;;   :credit/protocol-frac accrues to the fleet treasury (upgrade fund — the
;;   "investment" loop: treasury buys RAM/Thunderbolt, which raises the
;;   fleet's servable model class, which raises demand for credits).

   :tokens used to be exempt, on the reasoning that per-token pricing is 'sane

   The default came from the kotoba oracle as `(defn default-per-token [] :i64 1)`
   -- 1 credit/token, i.e. $10,000 per million tokens, roughly 20,000x market.
   Nobody chose that number: 1 is simply the smallest positive i64, and it
   became the price of every model onboarded before its pricing was backfilled.
   A default nobody picked is not a default; it is an accident with a fallback's
   syntax. Prices now come from `murakumo.infer.prices` (resources/murakumo/
   prices.edn), and text bills in :mtokens-in/:mtokens-out -- a unit whose
   natural magnitude cannot be produced by an integer floor.

;;
;; Until 2026-07-25 the only thing anyone could do with credits was burn them on
;; this fleet's inference, which made the ACCEPTANCE DENSITY of the unit exactly
;; 1 -- the operator's own fleet was the sole acceptor. A non-redeemable unit's
;; value is bounded by the number of distinct things it buys, so that 1 was the
;; binding constraint on the whole credits sphere, and ADR-2607995000's own
;; Consequences section already conceded it ("witness 報酬が credits 建てである
;; 限り外部第三者の参加誘因は弱い").
;;
;; The membrane table in that ADR is EXHAUSTIVE ("ここに無い流れは禁止"), and
;; holder-to-holder transfer was not in it. adr-ledger seq 73 adds exactly one
;; row -- credits -> third-party seller, credits-denominated -- and changes
;; nothing else. Specifically still forbidden, and NOT touched here:
;; credits->fiat/USDC (both directions of redemption), credits<->EN, EN<->USDC.
;;
;; Transferability is not redeemability. A transferred credit still cannot leave
;; the economy, so §1's structural non-speculation proof (neither internal unit
;; is redeemable, therefore neither can be an investment) survives intact.
;;
;; Two invariants the amend requires, both enforced here:
;;   1. CONSERVATION -- a transfer moves value, it never creates or destroys it.
;;      Issuance stays labor-only (settled runs and settled witness duty).
;;   2. NON-NEGATIVE BALANCES -- credits are a PREPAID usage claim, not a credit
;;      line. This is exactly where credits must NOT behave like EN: EN is
;;      net-zero mutual credit with a declared negative credit-limit, and if
;;      credits acquired an overdraft they would quietly become a second mutual
;;      credit system, collapsing the credits<->EN separation §1 draws.

   Why this is a separate fn rather than a check inside `balances`: `balances`
   is the historical fold that existing feeds and the CF Worker already run, and
   changing what it returns would retroactively reinterpret feeds already
   written. So the invariant is added alongside it, not inside it.

   Why it matters more than it did yesterday, stated plainly: `spend` has never
   checked that the spender could afford the spend. While the only payee was the
   operator's own fleet, an overdraft cost the operator and nobody else. Once a
   THIRD-PARTY seller can be paid in credits (adr-ledger seq 73), an unchecked
   overdraft is a path to taking real goods and services from a stranger with
   credits that were never earned. Any admission path for a transfer must run
   this and refuse on a non-empty result.
