(ns murakumo.infer.orchestrate
  "The autonomous control loop: read fleet capacity + request demand from
  murakumo's own public data, compute a demand-aware placement (rebalance.cljc),
  and publish the decision back as murakumo data. One tick = one closed loop:

    GET  /infer/fleet   → capacity (anonymized snapshot)
    GET  /infer/runs    → demand (recent request mix)
    rebalance/target    → placement plan + moves
    POST /infer/placement (record the decision — the fleet's desired state)

  bb entrypoints:
    bb murakumo infer orchestrate            one tick, print + publish
    bb murakumo infer orchestrate --watch=N  loop every N seconds

  This is I/O (HTTP) so it lives in a .clj (not the portable .cljc core). The
  decision itself is pure murakumo.infer.rebalance — this only wires it to live
  data. Applying moves to nodes (restarting engines) is a separate, gated step;
  here we compute + publish the desired placement, which the reconcile path
  (murakumo.core reconcile) can then converge nodes toward."
