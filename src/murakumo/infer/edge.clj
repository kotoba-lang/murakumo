  "Resident launchd plans for the Murakumo edge replica and queue worker.

  ## These are LaunchDaemons, and that is the whole point

  They were LaunchAgents until 2026-09-09. Measured that day on all six
  reachable minis: `who` is empty and /dev/console is owned by root, so no
  interactive session exists, so `~/Library/LaunchAgents` is never loaded and
  `launchctl` from ssh answers `125: Domain does not support specified action`.
  The workers that were running had been started by hand -- 10d21h old on hosts
  that had booted 24 days earlier, a two-week gap in which those nodes served
  nothing and nobody could see it, because a node that is enrolled and dark and
  a node that is enrolled and busy both answer the registry the same way.

  That mattered more than a missing convenience, because the cure for the three
  dark nodes is a reboot: their ephemeral port range is full of TIME_WAIT the
  kernel does not reclaim (benjamin 48,298 of 49,152; the count was unchanged
  45 s after its producer was killed). So the fleet was in a loop -- the repair
  is a reboot, and a reboot is what the supervision could not survive.

  A LaunchDaemon in the system domain loads at boot with no login, which is
  what `murakumo.infer.clj` already does for the RPC worker. `UserName` keeps
  the process running as the node user, because the model, the nbb runtime and
  `join.env` all live under that user's home.

  Ranked first, unanimously, by `murakumo.cluster.cosci`: every admissible
  design in that tournament is `:launch-daemon-system`, and it is the one
  dimension whose answer does not depend on any unmeasured input."

  launchd. A node cannot hold two dedicated models because they would be the

  than joining it. The edge pair is the same plane under an older name, so a
