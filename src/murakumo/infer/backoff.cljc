  "How a node-resident poller waits after a failure.

  Measured 2026-09-02 (ADR-260902-fleet-outbound-hygiene): `infer-join`'s
  poll loop retried a failed fetch on its fixed 5 s cadence with no backoff.
  Once the node's ephemeral port range was full of TIME_WAIT sockets, every
  fetch failed instantly with EADDRNOTAVAIL, every retry opened another
  connection, and the range never drained — on benjamin for 60 days. The
  same exhaustion made the mesh watchdog's own probe fail, so it killed a
  healthy kotoba-server every two minutes on simeon.

  Two rules, both pure so the JVM suite executes them:
    1. a failure doubles the wait, bounded (`next-delay-ms`), with jitter so a
       fleet of workers does not re-synchronise on the gateway;
    2. a failure is CLASSIFIED (`classify`), because the right response to
       'my own ports are exhausted' is to wait a long time and say so — not to
       treat it as the gateway being down."
