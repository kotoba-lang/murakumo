;; murakumo.infer.media — media generation over the fleet's resident ComfyUI.
;;
;; Image/video/audio jobs are the media-first face of murakumo inference
;; (ADR-2607030030 amendment): each job runs WHOLE on one node — job-parallel,
;; no layer sharding, no RPC pipeline — so the fleet is a render farm and the
;; economics are Civitai-Buzz-shaped (credits per image/second), settled into
;; the same memory×time ledger as text inference.
;;
;; The workflow wire format is ComfyUI's API JSON — the same shape
;; comfyui-clj (kotoba-lang/comfyui) models as portable cljc data, so this
;; bb operator can later hand graphs to that engine unchanged.
;;
;;   bb murakumo infer media nodes                  which nodes serve which checkpoints
;;   bb murakumo infer media generate <node> "<prompt>" [neg] [WxH] [steps]
;;
;; Fleet ports stay unexposed: dispatch + polling ride ssh loopback curls,
;; the image comes home over scp.
