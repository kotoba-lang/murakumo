;; murakumo.infer.plan — exo-style memory-weighted shard planning (pure cljc).
;;
;; Given a model descriptor and the fleet's live memory map, decide which nodes
;; participate and which CONTIGUOUS layer range each node serves, proportional to
;; its usable memory (exo's ring memory-weighted partitioning). Pure data → data:
;; no SSH, no engine, no platform — so the same planner runs in bb (the terminal
;; operator), on the JVM (tests), in the CF Worker (cloud-murakumo), and inside a
;; kotoba WASM component.
;;
;; The planner is engine-agnostic: it emits layer ranges + byte estimates. Engine
;; adapters (murakumo.infer.engine) turn a plan into concrete process commands
;; (llama.cpp --rpc/--tensor-split, mlx.launch ring, …).
;;
;; W6 product-shell + T6.4: GiB/defaults/usable-bytes/choose-strategy name require
;; the shipped `:infer-plan` KIR on **every** platform. Host pure mirrors are gone
;; — cljs/nbb must preload shipped KIR (resources/ via nbb cwd, register-kir!, or
;; set-resource-loader!) before requiring this ns
;; (ADR-260731-w6-t64-infer-plan-credits-mirror-delete).
;; Partition walk and plan map assembly stay cljc (float/vector host path).
