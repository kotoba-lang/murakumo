(ns murakumo.apikey
  "Issue and inspect murakumo API keys (`mk1` capability tokens) from a runtime
  that actually runs today.

  ## Why this namespace exists

  The gateway's own 401 tells you to `bb murakumo token issue` — and that command
  cannot be run: `murakumo.core/cmd-token` is a JVM/bb namespace requiring
  `babashka.process`, and `bb.edn` was removed when babashka was retired
  (ADR-2607173000). So the documented way to obtain a key had no working
  entrypoint. This namespace is that entrypoint, on nbb.

  It deliberately does NOT go through `murakumo.token`, which has since become
  Kotoba-oracle-backed (`signing-input` etc. dispatch through
  `murakumo.kotoba.oracle`) and drags that whole chain into a task whose only job
  is one HMAC. Instead it implements the wire format directly against Node's
  crypto, and `test/murakumo/apikey_parity_test.clj` proves byte-equality with
  `cloud-murakumo.token` — the namespace that actually VERIFIES these tokens.
  Compatibility is therefore tested, not asserted.

  ## Wire format (must match cloud-murakumo.token)

      mk1.<payloadSeg>.<sig>
      payloadSeg = b64url(json {\"sub\":…,\"scope\":…,\"iat\":N,\"exp\":N})
      sig        = b64url(HMAC-SHA256(secret, \"mk1.\" + payloadSeg))

  b64url is RFC-4648 url-safe, unpadded. The gateway recomputes the signature over
  the LITERAL received `mk1.<payloadSeg>` bytes, never a re-serialisation, so JSON
  key order is not part of the contract — we still emit a fixed order so the same
  inputs always produce the same token.

  ## The secret

  `$MURAKUMO_TOKEN_SECRET`, read by exact name — never an ambient env dump. It is
  the operator's; it signs here and verifies on the gateway, and is never embedded
  in a token. Absent ⇒ we refuse and say so. Minting is not something to do
  half-configured: a token signed with the wrong secret fails at the gateway with
  an indistinguishable 401."

;; open. An earlier version of this namespace hard-refused anything outside

;; murakumo-generation.js actually mints with — i.e. it invented a restriction
;; the gateway does not have and would have refused a key the backend needs.
;;
;; Kept only to catch typos: an unrecognised scope still issues, with a warning,
;; because a scope this list has not heard of is far more likely to be a new
;; backend than a mistake.
