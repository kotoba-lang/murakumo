  "Install the resident edge jobs on fleet nodes as system LaunchDaemons.

  `murakumo.infer.edge` renders the plists. Until 2026-09-09 nothing installed
  them: a workspace-wide grep for `edge-join` outside that namespace and its
  test returned zero hits, while ten minis were running plists somebody had
  placed by hand. A module with no reader is not a mechanism, and the fleet was
  proving it -- the rendered plan said LaunchAgent, the nodes ran LaunchAgent,
  and neither could survive a reboot, so the three exhausted nodes could not be
  repaired by the one action that would have repaired them.

  This namespace is that reader.

  Two things it deliberately does NOT do:

  - It does not reboot. The exhausted nodes need one, and `murakumo.cluster.cosci`
    ranks guarded self-reboot into the winning design, but a reboot is only safe
    once supervision survives it -- which is what this installs. Sequencing the
    repair is the operator's call and the ADR records why.
  - It does not enroll. Trust tier belongs to `fleet.edn` and the join worker
    reads it; installing a daemon must not be a second place a tier can be set."

  The second pair is exactly the two nodes ADR-2609021500 says were provisioned

  never done. So the fleet-wide backoff contract that ADR declared was live on
  two nodes out of five, and every fix since has been stranded the same way.

  `kotoba/lang/text.cljc` is vendored INTO `<root>/src` rather than added to a
