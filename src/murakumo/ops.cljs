;; murakumo.ops — the fleet read surface, ported to nbb.
;;
;;   nbb src/murakumo/ops.cljs status [all|node,node] [--format edn]
;;
;; Why this exists: ADR-2607173000 Wave 3 removed bb.edn and carried over only
;; three shell-out tasks, so `murakumo nodes` and `murakumo status` — the
;; operator's read loop — have had NO runnable entrypoint since (ADR-2607256000
;; finding 3). This restores that surface on the supported script host, folding
;; both old commands into ONE per-node round trip:
;;
;;   nodes  -> tailscale reachability, ssh reachability, mesh binary + agent
;;   status -> /health, wasm_executor, peer links, hosted component CIDs
;;
;; The bb version needed 3-4 sequential ssh calls per node for that; this issues
;; one, over the multiplexed connection murakumo.tunnel sets up.
;;
;; Decision logic is NOT re-implemented here: the probe command, the H:/L:/P:
;; line parsing and the snapshot row shape all come from the portable
;; murakumo.dash.state core the bb dashboard already used.
