;; murakumo.overlay.witness-treasury — the final composition ADR-2607110300
;; Phase 3 has been building toward across THREE independently-developed,
;; independently-tested repos, with nothing left calling all of them
;; together until this file:
;;
;;   1. `murakumo.overlay.witness-write/write-record-with-real-quorum!` --
;;      a REAL pre-commit witness quorum over murakumo's overlay QUIC
;;      transport, drawn from real fleet.edn nodes, reputation/stake
;;      updated from the outcome (ADR-2607110300 Phase 2/4, verified
;;      working end-to-end: 16 tests/47 assertions across this repo's own
;;      overlay-witness-* test suite).
;;   2. `kekkai.governor`'s `:treasury/release` op -- deny-by-default value
;;      governance gated on a witness-quorum verdict, ALWAYS escalating to
;;      a human for real fund release (ADR-2607110300 Phase 3, verified
;;      end-to-end through the full CoordinationActor StateGraph in
;;      kekkai's own treasury_contract_test.clj: clean release requires
;;      human signoff then commits; missing/rejected verdicts hold).
;;
;; Both halves already existed, fully tested, in their own repos -- what
;; was missing was a caller sitting where BOTH dependencies are available
;; (kekkai doesn't vendor witness-quorum "by design" per governor.cljc's
;; own docstring; cloud-murakumo can't either, per its "single-checkout,
;; no-west-workspace" constraint documented in ledger/witness.cljc and
;; verify/compute.cljc). murakumo already depends on witness-quorum
;; (Phase 2) and already talks to kekkai (murakumo.kekkai, for tailnet
;; admission) -- this is the natural, already-established meeting point.
;;
;; Honesty note (same as witness-write.clj and kekkai.governor.cljc): a
;; :witnessed quorum here is crash-fault tolerance across physical
;; machines under ONE operator (fleet.edn), not Byzantine consensus across
;; independent third parties, and kekkai's governor NEVER auto-commits a
;; :treasury/release regardless of how clean the quorum verdict is -- real
;; money always waits on a human's :approval. This file does not change
;; either of those properties; it only lets a real witness-quorum verdict
;; reach kekkai's (already-built) human-signoff pipeline instead of that
;; pipeline only ever being exercised with hand-built test verdicts.
