;; murakumo.overlay.witness-dial — nbb (ClojureScript-on-Node) client for
;; the cloud-murakumo witness-rpc wire protocol (same wire contract as
;; murakumo.overlay.witness-http-transport/http-dial!, ADR-2607110300
;; Phase 3), runnable on any fleet node with Node.js already present --
;; NO JVM install required. Matches this org's runtime priority (kotoba
;; wasm > clojurewasm > ClojureScript > nbb, demoting JVM to a last
;; resort, CLAUDE.md 2026-07-10): witness_http_transport.clj's http-dial!
;; is JVM-only because it composes with witness-quorum's JVM-only Ed25519
;; attestation signing (produce-http-witnessed-attestation); this script
;; is the client-only dial capability alone, which has no such JVM
;; dependency and should not carry one.
;;
;; Verified live against real fleet.edn machines (naphtali, zebulun) over
;; the real Tailscale mesh via `npx --yes nbb` -- fleet nodes need Node.js
;; only, not a JVM, to act as witness-rpc clients (ADR-2607110300
;; addendum, 2026-07-10).
;;
;; Run as a standalone CLI: nbb -m murakumo.overlay.witness-dial <url> <edn-payload>
;;   e.g. nbb -m murakumo.overlay.witness-dial http://100.86.235.122:28700/witness \
;;          '{:inv {:job/id "j1"} :claimed-cids ["bafy-x" "bafy-y"]}'
;;   or on a fresh fleet node with no local nbb install:
;;     npx --yes nbb -m murakumo.overlay.witness-dial <url> <edn-payload>
;;
;; `-main` is invoked ONLY via `nbb -m` (which calls a namespace's -main
;; with the trailing argv), not via a top-level call in this file --
;; that top-level-call pattern is exactly what murakumo.overlay.
;; witness-dial-attest's real-network test caught: requiring this ns as
;; a library (to reuse `dial!`) would otherwise re-trigger the CLI's
;; -main/process.exit on every require, which is wrong for a library.
