(ns murakumo.overlay.witness-http-transport
  "witness-quorum attestation production backed by cloud-murakumo's
   HTTP witness RPC (cloud_murakumo.verify.witness-rpc, ADR-2607110300
   Phase 3) -- the 'deployment glue' both witness_rpc.clj's and
   verify/compute.cljc's docstrings explicitly deferred: 'a caller WITH
   a real witness-quorum dependency (deployment glue, not this repo)
   composes the two.' murakumo is that caller -- it already depends on
   witness-quorum (Phase 2, for the QUIC-based
   murakumo.overlay.witness-transport), so this is the natural home:

     - NOT in cloud-murakumo itself, which deliberately stays
       witness-quorum-dependency-free (single-checkout, no-west-workspace
       deploy constraint -- see cloud-murakumo's pay/core.cljc vendoring
       note).
     - NOT in witness-quorum itself, which stays cloud-murakumo-agnostic
       (a generic quorum library with no business knowing what a GPU
       recompute job looks like).

   The HTTP wire format below (request/response envelope, /witness path,
   EDN body) DUPLICATES cloud_murakumo.verify.witness-rpc's shape rather
   than requiring that repo -- this is a wire CONTRACT two independent
   services agree on, not shared code (murakumo has no dependency edge to
   cloud-murakumo, and shouldn't grow one just to speak its RPC format,
   any more than an HTTP client library needs to depend on every server
   it talks to)."
