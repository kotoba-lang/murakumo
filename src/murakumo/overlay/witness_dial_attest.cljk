;; murakumo.overlay.witness-dial-attest — the nbb-native sibling of
;; witness_http_transport.clj's produce-http-witnessed-attestation (JVM),
;; composing witness_dial.cljs's HTTP dial with kotoba-lang/witness-quorum's
;; nbb attestation signing (signer.cljs/attestation.cljs, added alongside
;; this file's session). A fleet node running plain nbb (no JVM at all)
;; can now both dial a cloud-murakumo witness-rpc endpoint AND produce a
;; real, independently-verifiable Ed25519-signed witness-quorum
;; attestation over the result.
;;
;; witness-dial/dial! is async (Promise, since js/fetch is async);
;; witness-quorum's attestation/produce-attestation is fully synchronous
;; (matches the JVM version's contract exactly). Rather than making
;; produce-attestation promise-aware (which would diverge its API from
;; the JVM sibling), this file awaits the dial FIRST, then calls the
;; unmodified synchronous produce-attestation with a :deterministic
;; validator that's just a closure returning the already-fetched verdict.
;;
;; Requires kotoba-lang/witness-quorum's signer.cljs/attestation.cljs on
;; the classpath (sibling checkout under orgs/kotoba-lang/, matching this
;; monorepo's layout -- see kototama/web/generate.cljs for the same
;; convention):
;;   nbb --classpath "../witness-quorum/src" witness_dial_attest.cljs ...
