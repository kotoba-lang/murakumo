;; ── internal-trust header (ADR-2608124000) ───────────────────────────────────
;; `murakumo.identity/op-token` mints an UNSIGNED, never-expiring operator bearer
;; and this namespace attaches it to every repo.write. kotoba-server does not
;; verify that signature, so the only thing separating that token from a forged
;; one is the `require_internal_trust` gate — and that gate returns success
;; whenever KOTOBA_INTERNAL_SECRET is unset, which it is across this fleet.
;;
;; Sending the header to a server with the secret unset is therefore a complete
;; no-op: the header is never read. That is what makes shipping it now safe, and
;; it is the required ordering — every caller must demonstrably send it BEFORE
;; the server side can be armed. Arming the server first would break every
;; caller at once, and this particular caller is a background snapshot/reconcile
;; write whose only signal is a boolean, so it would break QUIETLY.
;;
;; The variable name is deliberately the one the server and the Cloudflare
;; gateway already read, so arming the fleet later is one variable rather than
;; one per caller. The value is read from the environment or it is absent — it
;; is never minted, generated or defaulted here.
;;
;; The header NAME lives host-side rather than in `kotoba/persist_core.kotoba`
;; on purpose: the oracle is loaded from shipped KIR in `resources/`, so adding
;; an export the shipped KIR does not carry would fail `require-ready!` and take
;; the whole namespace down. Move it into persist_core.kotoba the next time that
;; KIR is regenerated.
