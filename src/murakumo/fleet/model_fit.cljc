  "Does this model, at this context, run STABLY on this node?

  Owner instruction 2026-09-10: find out which models run stably on 16 GiB,
  and write it down. This namespace is the `stably` part -- the rule that turns
  a probe's samples into a verdict -- because the interesting failures measured
  that day were not the model refusing to load.

  ## Three ways a model can be `running` and the node still be useless

  1. **It loads and the machine swaps.** The weights are mmap'd, so a model
     that does not fit does not fail: it pages. Throughput collapses and
     nothing reports an error.

  2. **It loads, does not swap, and the node goes dark.** This is the one
     nothing was measuring. A node earns its place in the pool by sending a
     heartbeat that ARRIVES; if inference starves the machine's network stack,
     the heartbeat misses its deadline and the gateway drops the node while
     llama-server sits there answering /health. Measured 2026-09-10: one
     transient miss put issachar's heartbeat into a 60-75 s backoff against a
     60 s freshness line, and it went stale for seven minutes while healthy.
     A 27B at ctx 32768 took levi off the network entirely the day before.

  3. **It loads, does not swap, stays reachable, and has no room left.** A
     config admitted with single-digit-percent free memory has no margin for
     the next thing the machine is asked to do.

  So a verdict needs all three, and the thresholds are not invented here: they
  come from the gateway's own constants (see `heartbeat-deadline-ms`)."
  (:require [kotoba.lang.text :as str]))

(def heartbeat-deadline-ms
  "The gateway's freshness line, from `local-murakumo.readiness/default-stale-ms`.

  ⚠ The control plane carries a SECOND constant, `node-heartbeat-stale-ms`
  (120 s). The two disagree, and this takes the tighter one: a node that
  satisfies 60 s satisfies both, and a rule built on the looser number would
  call a config stable that the stricter check drops."

(def outbound-budget-ms
  "How long one outbound request may take, while inference runs, before this
  calls the node at risk of going dark.

  A quarter of the deadline. The heartbeat is one request in a loop that also
  polls and posts results, so spending the whole window on a single call is
  already failure; and the backoff measured on 2026-09-10 means ONE miss costs
  60-75 s, not one interval. The quarter is a judgement, and it is stated here
  as a number rather than buried in a comparison so it can be argued with."
