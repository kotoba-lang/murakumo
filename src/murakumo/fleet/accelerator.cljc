;; murakumo.fleet.accelerator — accelerator memory admission (host face).
;;
;; The pure truth is kotoba/accelerator_budget_core.kotoba, shipped as
;; resources/murakumo/oracle/accelerator_budget_core.kir.edn. This namespace
;; only measures, folds and names; it decides nothing.
;;
;; ## Why measuring is a separate namespace from deciding
;;
;; ADR-2608318500 measured gad: an aperture of 71.3 GB with a Hunyuan3D
;; instance holding 81.77 GB of it, and 262 core dumps since 2026-08-14
;; because the order of operations was start -> allocate -> the driver dies.
;; The missing step was a test, and a test that reads its own inputs from a
;; config file is not a test -- CLAUDE.md's first question is what a check
;; returns when it could not measure, and `pass` is the defect.
;;
;; So `probe-command` reads sysfs and `parse-probe` folds it, and BOTH of them
;; are allowed to answer `unmeasured`. That answer propagates into the core as
;; a -1 aperture and comes back out as a REFUSAL, never as an empty device.
;;
;; Host keeps: ssh/exec, sysfs paths, /proc walking, string parsing.
;; Pure: every comparison and every byte of arithmetic.
