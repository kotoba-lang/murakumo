  "One node hosts one model. Pure decisions over a node's process list.

  Owner instruction 2026-09-10: the murakumo cloud fleet is to be designed so
  that a node hosts, as a rule, a single model.

  ## What was actually running

  Measured the same day across the six reachable minis, and the rule was broken
  on every one of them:

    node       llama-server  rpc-server  ComfyUI  ollama
    dan             1            1          1       1
    judah           1            1          0       1
    joseph          1            1          1       1
    benjamin        1            1          1       1
    issachar        1            1          1       1
    simeon          1            1          1       1

  Four model planes on one 16 GiB machine. That is not a tidiness complaint:
  measuring the 27B on levi the previous day required stopping the edge server
  (7.9 GB resident), ComfyUI, ollama and the RPC worker before the weights
  would load at all, and a 32k-token context then took the node off the network
  entirely. A node that hosts four models has no model it can actually serve at
  full size, and nothing in the fleet said so.

  ## Why an idle process still counts

  Only llama-server is large at rest — 7.9 GB on issachar, against ComfyUI's
  0.68 GB and an rpc-server and ollama both under 200 MB. Counting only
  resident bytes would call those three free and they are not: each claims
  memory the moment it is asked to work, and the failure that produces is a
  node that looks like it has room right up to the moment two models are busy
  together. So this counts HOSTS, not bytes.

  `rpc-server` counts even though the model it serves belongs to another node.
  It lends this machine's RAM and GPU to gad's distributed ring, which is
  hosting part of a model by any definition that matters to the node's own
  capacity.

  ## What this namespace is not

  It does not decide which model a node should host, and it does not perform
  an eviction. It answers one question — how many model planes are on this
  node, and which — and names the launchd jobs each plane is served by, so
  that the installer can refuse to add a second and an eviction can be
  reviewed before it is run."
  (:require [kotoba.lang.text :as str]))

(def planes
  "Process signatures that mean a model is hosted here, and which plane it
  serves. Ordered: the first match wins, so a more specific signature has to
  come before a more general one.

  Matched on the command line rather than the executable name because the
  same binary serves different planes -- `llama-server` is the node's own
  model, `rpc-server` is a shard of somebody else's.

  Matched case-INSENSITIVELY, and each signature is specific enough to be a
  program rather than a word. The first version matched `ComfyUI` exactly,
  which is how gad spells it; the six minis spell it `comfyui/main.py`, so the
  checker reported them as hosting three planes when they host four. An
  under-report is the dangerous direction here — it lets an install proceed
  onto a node that is already full. `comfyui/main.py` and `ollama serve` carry
  the specificity that case-sensitivity was standing in for, without the miss.

  `:daemons` are launchd labels KNOWN to serve the plane. They are a hint for
  reporting, NOT the eviction list -- see `discover-script` and
  `labels-from-discovery`, which ask launchd what it actually starts. Measured
  2026-09-10: benjamin serves the ad-hoc plane from `ai.gftd.ollama.benjamin`
  while dan and simeon use `com.murakumo.ollama`, so an eviction driven by this
  table left ollama running on benjamin and reported a clean sweep. A fixed
  table cannot name a label that varies per node.

  The original note stands for what these labels are FOR: Killing the
  process is not evicting the plane: measured on issachar 2026-09-10, all four
  planes were system LaunchDaemons with KeepAlive, so a `pkill` is undone in
  seconds and a `bootout` is undone by the next boot -- and the next boot is
  exactly when nobody is watching. An eviction that does not name the job is a
  restart with extra steps."
