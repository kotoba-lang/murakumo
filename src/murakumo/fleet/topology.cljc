  "What each node is FOR, compared with what it is doing.

  Owner instruction 2026-09-10: tidy the topology so the cluster runs
  efficiently and stably. This is the declaration half; `murakumo.fleet.one-model`
  is the measurement half, and `verdict` here is the only place the two meet.

  ## Why a declaration was needed at all

  `fleet.edn` has carried `:node/serves` on every node for some time and
  eleven of the twelve say `:unstated`. Nothing in murakumo or the API reads
  the field. So the fleet had a slot for its topology, empty, with no reader --
  and the consequences were all measured on 2026-09-10:

    - five minis each ran four model planes, and nothing said that was wrong
    - the media plane on those minis had rendered NOTHING, ever: 0 history
      entries, checkpoints unloaded, and on one node no checkpoint at all
    - a node was serving one model while the fleet console showed another
    - a 27B appeared on a node with no launchd job owning it, and only a
      process listing found it

  None of those are failures of a machine. They are failures of a fleet with
  no answer to `what is this node for`.

  ## The vocabulary is closed, and `:unstated` is not a default

    :unstated                                  nobody has decided yet
    :none                                      deliberately idle
    {:plane :text        :model \"murakumo-edge\"}
    {:plane :media       :model \"waiREALMIX_v11.safetensors\"}
    {:plane :ring-member}                      lends this node to another's ring
    {:plane :ad-hoc}                           whatever ollama holds

  `:unstated` is reported as `:unstated`, never as conformant and never as
  drift. A node nobody has decided about is not a node in the right state, and
  it is not a node in the wrong state either -- and a reconciler that treated
  it as either would either churn it or bless it. Both are worse than saying
  so."
