;;   nbb src/murakumo/aiueos.cljs image                 # build the release image
;;   nbb src/murakumo/aiueos.cljs verify                # USB boot equivalence gate

;; The fleet's other nodes are macOS machines reached over SSH, running
;; kotoba-server under a LaunchAgent. An aiueos node is not that: it is a
;; bare-metal OS with no Node, no JVM, and (today) no network stack, so none of
;; murakumo's SSH/launchctl provisioning applies to it. What an operator can do
;; is build and flash its medium, and compute the enrollment record it would
;; post — which is what this surface is.
;;
;; `enroll` deliberately does NOT reimplement the participation decision. It
;; calls `murakumo.infer.join`, the same namespace the rest of murakumo uses, and
;; then prints the wire arguments that aiueos's own mirror of that decision
;; (`os/aiueos/kotoba/murakumo-join-plan.kotoba`) would be handed for the same
;; node. Those two implementations are checked against each other across the
;; full matrix by `test/murakumo/aiueos_join_plan_parity_test.clj`; this command
;; is where the agreement gets used rather than merely asserted.
