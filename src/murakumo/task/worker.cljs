;; murakumo.task.worker — resident remote shells, one per node slot.
;;
;; ADR-2607256000/2607256500 left the task plane at a ~139ms per-task floor even
;; with connection multiplexing: every task still opened a fresh ssh CHANNEL and
;; started a remote shell. The gap list called for a resident worker on
;; kotoba-server — but only 5 of 11 fleet nodes currently run kotoba-server, so
;; that path would help barely half the fleet and would tie batch execution to
;; the mesh being healthy.
;;
;; This is the version that works on every reachable node today: keep ONE
;; `ssh host bash -s` alive per slot and feed it framed commands on stdin. The
;; cost per task collapses to a write plus a read on a channel that is already
;; open; the ssh handshake, channel open and shell start are paid once.
;;
;; Framing: each task is written as a subshell followed by the shared
;; `__murakumo_rc=` sentinel (murakumo.tunnel owns it) and an `__murakumo_end=<id>`
;; delimiter. The reader consumes the stream up to that delimiter, so a task's
;; output cannot bleed into the next one's.
;;
;; Honest trade-offs, both surfaced in the result map:
;;   - stderr is merged into stdout (`:stderr-merged? true`); one stream cannot
;;     be split back apart reliably without a second channel.
;;   - a task that hangs cannot be killed individually — the worker is killed and
;;     respawned, and the task is reported as :timeout? true. Remaining queue
;;     work continues on the fresh worker.
