;; murakumo.task.exec — nbb execution shell for the fleet task plane.
;;
;; The impure half of murakumo.task.plan: it turns a pure assignment
;; ({:task :node :host}) into a real remote process over Tailscale SSH, bounds
;; concurrency per node to that node's slot count, and times every task.
;;
;; Script host is nbb (ADR-2607173000: bb is retired, no new .mjs/.sh) — the
;; pure planner it drives stays .cljc so the same decisions also run on the JVM,
;; in the CF Worker, and inside a kotoba WASM component.
