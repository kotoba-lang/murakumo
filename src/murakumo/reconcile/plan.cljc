   Reach degrades rather than blocks: with no connect declaration to evaluate
   against, every node passes. That is a deliberate availability choice, but on
   its own it makes two different outcomes look identical -- \"these nodes
   satisfy the requirement\" and \"nobody checked\" both come back as a list of
   names. A caller that cares which one it got had no way to ask.

   `:reach-evaluated?` is that way. It is false exactly when a reach constraint
   was requested and skipped, so an operator placing browser-live work can tell
   whether the nodes were chosen or merely not excluded.

   ADR-2608170400 P3-5 wants placement to fail closed when the declaration and
   the observed listener inventory disagree. That needs an observed inventory,
   which does not exist yet; this is the half that can be true beforehand."
