;; murakumo.reconcile — the wadm half of murakumo.
;;
;; `deploy` is imperative (compile → distribute → publish, once). This namespace
;; is the DECLARATIVE control loop: you write a fleet manifest (`murakumo.app.edn`)
;; that says *what should be running and with what spread*, and `reconcile` folds
;; the live placement (from dash/collect) against it, computes the drift, and either
;; reports it (--dry-run) or converges the fleet to it (--apply / --watch).
;;
;; This mirrors the kotoba mesh ADR (docs/ADR-kotoba-mesh-wasm-hosting.md, L5):
;; desired state AND observed state are both datoms; the reconciler is just their
;; diff. So the CORE of this file is PURE (desired/observed → plan) and unit-tested
;; offline (test/murakumo/reconcile_test.clj) — no SSH, no fleet, deterministic.
;; The IMPURE shell (collect / deploy / persist) wraps that pure core.
