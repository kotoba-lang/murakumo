  "`token` — issue / verify murakumo API keys. The nbb port of the dropped
  bb-hosted `murakumo token` entrypoint (scripts/tasks.edn header, ADR-2607256000:
  the Wave-3 conversion left `token` with no runnable entrypoint, and it needs an
  nbb port rather than a re-added bb.edn).

  This matters beyond tidiness: cloud-murakumo's gateway answers an unauthorised
  /api/v1/* call with `mint one with 'bb murakumo token issue'` — a command that
  has not been runnable since babashka was retired. So the documented way to get
  a key pointed at nothing.

      nbb scripts/run-task.cljs token issue [--sub L] [--scope chat|image|all] [--ttl secs]
      nbb scripts/run-task.cljs token verify <token>

  Output discipline: the token alone goes to stdout so it pipes
  (`… token issue | pbcopy`); everything else goes to stderr.

  All logic lives in murakumo.apikey, shared with the MCP tool — so the two
  surfaces cannot drift, and neither parses the other's output."
