(ns murakumo.factory
  "The factory provisioning station — what turns `:tofu` into `:attested`.

  Without one, every box ships trusted-on-first-use: the fleet has no way to
  tell a device it manufactured from a device someone built to look like one.
  `aiueos.enroll` reports that honestly as `:tofu` rather than hiding it, and
  this namespace is what makes the other grade reachable.

  ## What the station does, and what it deliberately does not

  For each unit it issues a **birth certificate**: a document binding the
  hardware serial, the model and a per-device *factory* public key, signed by
  the factory root. It also draws the claim token that goes on the label.

  It does **not** generate the device's operational key. That is generated on
  the device at first boot and never leaves it (`aiueos.provider.device`). The
  factory key exists only to vouch for provenance; if it were also the
  operational key, the factory would hold every device's private half forever,
  which is the property the whole design exists to avoid.

  ## Usage

      kotoba run kotoba/factory.kotoba
      ;; leftover Java library (not a start path): murakumo.factory/-main
      ;; still issues keys when invoked as a namespace; do not add a
      ;; :factory alias. Guest owns admission only — keygen is HOLD.

  The root private key is read from a file the operator supplies. This
  namespace never generates a root key and never writes one: root custody is an
  operator decision, and a tool that silently created a root would make it
  ambiguous which root a fleet trusts."
