# validate  project shape, catalog, baseline splice (no kotoba CLI, no model)
# known     known-correct bodies verified by kotoba (check + wasm32-browser + instantiateKotoba)
# wrong     negative control; must be rejected
# jev       TypeSafe Jev chooses typed blocks (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY; spends credit)
# home      print the harness checkout path
#
# The harness is the commit pinned in kotoba-harness.pin.edn. It is fetched on
# first use (network) into ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/kotoba-harness/<sha> --
# outside this repository, so nbb never finds this repository's nbb.edn above
# it -- and reused only while that checkout is exactly the pinned commit with a
# clean worktree. KOTOBA_HARNESS_HOME uses an existing checkout instead.
# Verification also needs the kotoba CLI and amu's runtime/browser-host.mjs
# (KOTOBA_BROWSER_HOST); see the kotoba-harness README.
