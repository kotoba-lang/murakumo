  ## Why the pprint output is escaped before it is written

  `clojure.pprint/pprint` emits raw control bytes, exactly as `pr-str` does:
  measured 2026-08-19, `(with-out-str (pprint {:s \"a\\0b\"}))` is
  `[123 58 115 32 34 97 0 98 34 125 10]`. One raw byte makes `file(1)`
  classify the artefact as `data`, and grep then **skips it silently** --
  `grep -c something <file>` prints nothing and exits 1, which is exactly
  what a file not containing that string does.

  Exactly one of the 36 artefacts here is affected, and it is the one you
  would guess: `secret_core.kir.edn`, whose Kotoba source **rejects a NUL**
  and therefore contains one. The artefact was binary for the most ordinary
  of reasons.

  It was escaped by hand elsewhere in this workspace on 2026-08-18 and the
  generator put the bytes straight back on the next run. Fixing an artefact
  does not hold while the generator can emit it, which is why the escaping
  is here and not in a checker.

  `kotoba.lang.edn/escape-controls` is the one definition of the rule --
  reimplementing it here would be two that can disagree. It is idempotent,
  so running the generator twice is a no-op, and it changes no value:
  `\\u0000` reads back as the same character, so the parsed KIR is equal
  either way and any digest over the VALUE is untouched. Layout whitespace
  is left alone; escaping it would collapse the document and stop it
  parsing, which is a mistake made and corrected upstream the same day."
